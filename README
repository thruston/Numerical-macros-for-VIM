Numerical macros for VIM

Toby Thurston -- 10 Oct 2011 

A small set of macros that I find useful to enhance VIM.  Comments always welcome. 
 
Read the comments in the source files for details.  Better still, use the perl POD tools 
to get detailed guides to the perl tools, and pydoc for the python ones. 

Changes
