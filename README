Numerical macros for VIM

Toby Thurston -- 01 Dec 2014 

A small set of macros that I find useful to enhance VIM.  Comments always welcome. 
 
- table.pl is a filter to help you work with tables
- proust.py is an "in situ" calculator

Read the comments in the source files for details.  Better still, use the perl POD tools 
to get detailed guides to the perl tools, and pydoc for the python ones.
